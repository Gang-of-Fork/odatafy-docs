What are odatafy plugins? plugins are the most essential part of developing an application with odatafy. They are installed as npm packages and help you to adapt odatafy to your use-case. One example is the odatafy-mongodb plugin which uses the core odatafy-parser to convert oData URLs to MongoDB queries.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#official-odatafy-documentation","text":"This is the official odatafy documentation, it contains information about all odatafy realted repositories. odatafy and its plugins are currently deleoped as an npm package.","title":"Official odatafy documentation"},{"location":"#what-is-odatafy","text":"odatafy is an ecosystem of npm modules that aim to help you create oData compatible REST-APIs, thus allowing you to accelerate development and safe time and money by helping you to implement an API that is based on the very-well established oData standard.","title":"What is odatafy?"},{"location":"#what-are-odatafy-plugins","text":"plugins are the most essential part of developing an application with odatafy.
